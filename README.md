# Personal Website
## Jack Colvin

This web app is used to showcase Jack Colvin's full stack development skills. Individuals are encouraged to use it to promote themselves as needed, ideally while contributing their own improvements to the repository, to benefit those who follow.

***

#### __Tested with:__

Node.js version 11.14.0

Npm version 6.9.0

Gatsby version 2.6.7

Manjaro Linux

Chrome, Firefox, Android, iOS.

## 1) Quickstart
### a) Configuration

After cloning the repository, and assuming nodejs is installed, run 
```
npm install --save gatsby-cli
```
followed by
```
npm i
```
in the root directory to install the needed dependencies.

### b) Dev Server Execution
To run the website live and with hot reloading enabled, enter the following in the root project directory:
```
gatsby develop
```

Now, the default Gatsby site is available at localhost on port 8000.

In a web browser of your choice, navigate to __http://localhost:8000__.
Here, you should have a functioning web page.

### c) Local GraphQL Deployment 

You'll notice that your project page displays a "call to GraphQL endpoint failed" error on the projects pane.

To resolve this error, you'll need to instantiate a GraphQL endpoint and a corresponding database.

The recommended solution is to consult https://www.github.com/JackPColvin/personal-website-hasura for a backend quickstart repository for the project.
